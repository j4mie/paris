Models

Model Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should create a model class for each entity in your application. For
example, if you are building an application that requires users, you
should create a ``User`` class. Your model classes should extend the
base ``Model`` class:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
    }

Paris takes care of creating instances of your model classes, and
populating them with *data* from the database. You can then add
*behaviour* to this class in the form of public methods which implement
your application logic. This combination of data and behaviour is the
essence of the `Active Record pattern`_.

Database Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your ``User`` class should have a corresponding ``user`` table in your
database to store its data.

By default, Paris assumes your class names are in *CapWords* style, and
your table names are in *lowercase\_with\_underscores* style. It will
convert between the two automatically. For example, if your class is
called ``CarTyre``, Paris will look for a table named ``car_tyre``.

If you are using namespaces then they will be converted to a table name
in a similar way. For example ``\Models\CarTyre`` would be converted to
``models_car_tyre``. Note here that backslashes are replaced with underscores
in addition to the *CapWords* replacement discussed in the previous paragraph.

To disregard namespace information when calculating the table name, set a
**public static** property named ``$_table_use_short_name`` on your class.
This would result in ``\Models\CarTyre`` being converted to ``car_tyre``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
        public static $_table_use_short_name = true;
    }

To override the default naming behaviour and directly specify a table name,
add a **public static** property to your class called ``$_table``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
        public static $_table = 'my_user_table';
    }

Auto Prefixing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To save having type out model class name prefixes whenever code utilises ``Model::for_table()``
it is possible to specify a prefix that will be prepended onto the class name.

See the :doc:`Configuration` documentation for more details.

ID Column
~~~~~~~~~

Paris requires that your database tables have a unique primary key
column. By default, Paris will use a column called ``id``. To override
this default behaviour, add a **public static** property to your class
called ``$_id_column``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
        public static $_id_column = 'my_id_column';
    }

**Note** - Paris has its *own* default ID column name mechanism, and
does not respect column names specified in Idiormâ€™s configuration.
