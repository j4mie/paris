[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/j4mie/paris.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/j4mie/paris)

[http://j4mie.github.com/idiormandparis/](http://j4mie.github.com/idiormandparis/)

A lightweight Active Record implementation for PHP5.

Built on top of [Idiorm](http://github.com/j4mie/idiorm/).

Tested on PHP 5.2.0+ - may work on earlier versions with PDO and the correct database drivers.

Released under a [BSD license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses).

Features
--------

* Extremely simple configuration.
* Exposes the full power of [Idiorm](http://github.com/j4mie/idiorm/)'s fluent query API.
* Supports associations.
* Simple mechanism to encapsulate common queries in filter methods.
* Built on top of [PDO](http://php.net/pdo).
* Uses [prepared statements](http://uk.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php) throughout to protect against [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) attacks.
* Database agnostic. Currently supports SQLite, MySQL, Firebird and PostgreSQL. May support others, please give it a try!
* Supports collections of models with method chaining to filter or apply actions to multiple results at once.
* Multiple connections are supported

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is hosted on Read the Docs: [paris.rtfd.org](http://paris.rtfd.org)

### Building the Docs ###

You will need to install [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) and then in the docs folder run:

    make html

The documentation will now be in docs/_build/html/index.html

Let's See Some Code
-------------------
```php
class User extends Model {
    public function tweets() {
        return $this->has_many('Tweet');
    }
}

class Tweet extends Model {}

$user = Model::factory('User')
    ->where_equal('username', 'j4mie')
    ->find_one();
$user->first_name = 'Jamie';
$user->save();

$tweets = $user->tweets()->find_many();
foreach ($tweets as $tweet) {
    echo $tweet->text;
}
```

Users who have PHP 5.3+ can simply do the following:
```php
$user = User::where_equal('username', 'j4mie')
    ->find_one();
```
instead of:
```php
$user = Model::factory('User')
    ->where_equal('username', 'j4mie')
    ->find_one();
```
